# raytracing
Simple raytracer, made for learning purpose. The aim is mostly to learn about raytracing, and about Rust.

Using https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html as a guideline.

## Current Progress

Output an image :
- Use the PPM file format

Vec3 struct:
- Operator Overloading, traits
- Simple functions for 3D vectors

Rays, a Simple Camera, and Background:
- Define Ray struct

Adding a Sphere
- Simple ray traced red sphere, computing wether the ray hits the sphere at all

Surface Normals and Multiple Objects
- Shading with surface normals
- Generalization of hittable objects
